# IntroToDatabaseMgmtSystems

Created a database for the American Cancer Research Institute to use computerized support to assimilate existing and future data and process these data into periodic reports for use by a variety of interested parties in evaluating the committeeâ€™s performance. Started by creating an ER Diagram visualizing the entities, attributes, relationships, and primary keys. Then, translated the relationships into Oracle using SQL statements.
